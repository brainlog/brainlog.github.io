      <h1>Brainlog</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my Page! I am Vatsal, Computer Science student at IIT Delhi. Currently I am TAing COL334 (Computer
        Networks) at IIT Delhi. I feel interested in making systems more efficient. I love problem solving. Sometimes in
        my free time, I play chess or look at some research papers related to different kinds of structural issues in
        societies and why they exist.</p>
